# 2 Feb 2014: We moved to GitHub https://github.com/freedomotic/freedomotic #


[Freedomotic](http://freedomotic.com) is an open source building and home automation software written in Java.

The aim of the project is to build a **data mashup oriented** building automation framework for seamless integration of building and home automation technologies, mobile, web and social networks. Freedomotic leverages modern distributed computing architectures, and provides crosslanguage APIs for extension.

With freedomotic you can create **your own** context aware/ambient aware applications. Take a look at this [introductive whitepaper](http://freedomotic.googlecode.com/files/freedomotic-whitepaper-v1.4.pdf)

## How it works ##

Freedomotic supports popular building automation technologies like BTicino `OpenWebNet`, KNX, Modbus RTU, X10 as well as custom automation projects using Arduino devices, do it yourself (DIY) boards, third party Android frontends, text to speech (TTS) engines, motion detection using IP cameras, social networks integration like Twitter, and much more... All this features are deliverd as downloadable plugins from [our marketplace](http://freedomotic.com/plugins).

## Who should be interested ##

**Private Users**:
Tired of incompatible, expensive automation technologies and remotes everywhere? Learn why [automate your home](http://freedomotic.com/content/freedomotic-privates) with freedomotic.

**Business Users**:
Museums, shops, offices,...? Learn how to [create innovative services](http://freedomotic.com/content/freedomotic-business) for your customers with freedomotic.

**Developers & Organizations**:
Freedomotic can be easily extended with cross-language plugins. If you want to [develop a plugin](http://freedomotic.com/content/freedomotic-developers) for an automation protocol, integrate your own "do it yourself" Arduino board or create a custom frontend with your brand [take a look here](http://freedomotic.com/content/freedomotic-developers).

## Where can it run ##

Freedomotic can run on any OS with Java support (Linux, Windows, Mac, â€¦). It can be deployed on a single standard PC, a PCs network, a network of embedded devices (like BeagleBoard or Raspberry Pi) to create a set-top-box, or a mixture of the previous.

## When will be available ##

Freedomotic is actually a working beta but is growing rapidly with the suppport of our community. We are searching for contributors and **you can contribute in many way, development or not, let us know writing to info@freedomotic.com**

## Main Features ##

  * **Open source**: GPLv2 license
  * **Distributed & Scalable**: can be deployed on a network of cheap peer-to-peer hardware node. It is scalable and provides automatic load balancing across nodes on the network.
  * **Cross-language**: it uses a message oriented middleware to exchange information between components (JSON and XML text messages)
  * **Cross-platform**: Freedomotic is written in Java so it can run on Windows, Linux, Mac, Solaris. Java JRE 6 is required.
  * **Event Based**: Every action in the real environment and every interaction with the system (eg: a click on the GUI) is mapped to an event. Events can be intercepted at runtime with Triggers making the behavior of the system fully configurable and not predeterminated. This way you can define automation at runtime using natural language like "if is cold turn on heater".
  * **Modular & Extensible**: Freedomotic is modular and can enrich its features using plugins. API are distributed along with the software to easely create new add-ons. It provides OSGi Framework features in a simpler way, leveraging well known OO programmig inheritance.
  * **Semantic-rich**: Freedomotic provides a semantic-rich knowledge of the environment to implement intelligence and reasoning systems. No coding is required, the environment can be described using our graphical editor.
  * **Hardware Agnostic**: Freedomotic has an hardware abstraction layer to abstract from hardware infrastructure (sensors and actuators) using events, triggers and commands.
