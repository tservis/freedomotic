## Predefined Events ##

Here is a list of the predefined Freedomotic events. The property name can be used in [Triggers](Trigger.md) to filter the event. A trigger is associated with one or more [Commands](Command.md) using a [Reaction](Reaction.md). Freedomotic permits to extends the event list as plugins, if the event is not one of the predefined please refer to the development manual provided with the event plugin.
