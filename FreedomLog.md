# Introduction #

Freedomotic logger is mainly useful for developers. We are currently in beta testing so it is enabled by default.

Scroll this page till the end to read the latest log records. Information records have green background, warnings and exceptions are highlighted with red background.


If the pop-up of this logger annoys you you can disable setting the parameter 'KEY\_LOGGER\_POPUP = **false**' in **FREEDOMOTIC\_ROOT\_FOLDER/config/config.xml**


This file can still be opened from **FREEDOMOTIC\_ROOT\_FOLDER/log/freedomlog.html**

To disable recording set the parameter 'KEY\_SAVE\_LOG\_TO\_FILE = **false**'
