Freedom is a building automation framework which cuts time and effort to develop your own building automation software. Fredom provides usefull features just like a CMS does for website development.

  * **Open source**: GPLv2 license
  * **Distributed**: can be deployed on a network of cheap peer-to-peer hardware node. It is scalable and provides automatic load balancing across nodes on the network.
  * **Cross-language**: it uses a MOM (ActiveMQ) to exchange information between components (JSON and XML text messages)
  * **Cross-platform**: Freedom is written in Java so it can run on Windows, Linux, Mac, Solaris. Java JRE 6 is required.
  * **Extensible**: Freedom is modular and can enrich its features using plugins. API are distributed along with the software to easely create new add-ons.
  * **Semantic-rich**: Freedom provides a semantic-rich knowledge of the environment to implement intelligence and reasoning systems. No coding is required, the environment can be described using our graphical editor.
  * **Hardware Agnostic**: Freedom has an hardware abstraction layer to abstract from hardware infrastructure (sensors and actuators) using events, triggers and command.
